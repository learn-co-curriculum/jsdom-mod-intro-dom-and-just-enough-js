# Intro to DOM Programming and Just Enough JavaScript

## Problem Statement

Once you understand how to write HTML and CSS, an exciting next step is to
learn JavaScript. That's where you are now!

JavaScript can do many kinds of work, from building web servers, to creating
"infinite scroll" effects. But it was originally designed to do a type of
programming called **Document-Object Model (DOM) programming**. Understanding
DOM programming is the _foundation_ of being a front-end developer. That's what
the next several lessons will teach.

DOM programming is using JavaScript to:

1. Ask the DOM to find or "select" an HTML element or elements in the rendered page
2. Remove the selected element(s) or insert a new element (and / or)
3. Adjust a property of the selected element(s)

For a broad overview, our next lessons will proceed by:

1. Teaching you JavaScript [sight words][sight] (this lesson)
2. Teaching you about the DOM (2 lessons)
3. Using the DOM to select elements
4. Using the DOM to add / remove elements
5. Using the DOM to change elements' appearance

## Explain the JavaScript / DOM Relationship

JavaScript was _born_ in the browser. It was literally made to work with
rendered browser content.

JavaScript changes rendered content through an intermediary called the DOM, the
Document Object Model. The DOM _only_ knows how to be spoken to in JavaScript.
JavaScript and the DOM have been there, together, since the beginning.

Because they're twins, learning about the DOM will require us to write some
JavaScript &mdash; which we don't know yet! And learning all the details of
JavaScript language won't tell us anything about the DOM. It would just tell us
how to write valid JavaScript code. It's a chicken-and-egg situation.

To get around this problem we start by learning some basic structures of
JavaScript called "sight words." We're going to learn "just enough JavaScript"
so that we can start working with the DOM &mdash; the best way to understand
it.

## Explain "Sight Words"

When you learned to read, before you understood the process of joining letters
into sounds and sounds into words, you had a limited, but powerful vocabulary.
This vocabulary contained your "[sight words][sight]." These are also the words
you tend to memorize before you go on a trip abroad: MEN, WOMEN, WATER, FOOD,
HOSPITAL.

This lesson will provide you the "sight words" of JavaScript.  Some of these
lines of code you might not fully understand at first and _that's OK_. We'll
cover them _all_ later in more depth when we discuss (*cue the trumpets*) The
JavaScript Programming Language.

## Explain "Just Enough JavaScript" Concept

We call the approach of learning JavaScript sight words "Just Enough
JavaScript." We learn so much better by working with technology than by
merely reading words.

We take this approach, well, because it's just more fun. It's fun to change
text on pages or update styling. Also, some of the JavaScript concepts tend to
sneak in along the way and make learning (*cue the trumpets*) The JavaScript
Programming Language easier.

It's OK to come back here if you get confused or forget something. You might
want to bookmark this page or keep it open in a tab as you move along. This is
all OK in the "Just Enough" approach. In the following sections we list several
"sight words" of JavaScript. If you want to know more about a sight word, feel
free to consult [MDN's JavaScript Reference][ref].

## Explain that JavaScript Has Things

It might sound a bit weird to say, but there are "Things" in JavaScript. Most
programming languages call these "types." For the moment we're going to call
them **Things**.

One type of Thing is a _Number_ like `2` or `3.14`.

Another type of Thing is an arrangement of characters, called a _String_ like
`"Byron"` or `'Please feed the dog'`. Strings are written inside of `"` **or**
`'`. Strings are quoted because  `if` _might_ mean something very special to
JavaScript (more on that later)...but it also might be the beginning of a bit
of text "if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs..."
`if`, in this case is a _reserved word_ &mdash; something special to
JavaScript. The String is, well, just some text.

## Explain that JavaScript Has Variables

Sometimes you want to hold a `String` or a `Number` under another name.

> **TYPOGRAPHICAL NOTE**: The `//=>` means "What JavaScript would return back".
> For now, think about what's "returned back" as an answer to a question that
> you're asking JavaScript. Sometimes, too, you tell JavaScript a fact and it
> will just return it to you.

```javascript
3.14 //=> 3.14
var pi = 3.14 //=> `undefined` and that is, uh, surprising. We'll cover that later!
pi //=> 3.14
```

JavaScript also lets you say:

```javascript
3.14 //=> 3.14
let pi = 3.14 //=> `undefined`
pi //=> 3.14
```

or

```javascript
3.14 //=> 3.14
const pi = 3.14 //=> `undefined`
pi //=> 3.14
```

When JavaScript first came out it had only `var`. Now it has `let` and `const`
too. We'll cover the differences between these later. They all tell JavaScript,
"Hey this is a name that I'm going to associate with some bit of information."

## Explain that JavaScript Can Compare Things

```javascript
1 < 3  //=> true
3 == 3 //=> true
3 != 4 //=> true
5 > 2  //=> true
```

Be careful here, `=` means "assign to," like we did with `var` just above. For
_comparison_ we use `==` (and, later on, `===`).

We can build on our previous example:

```javascript
3.14 //=> 3.14
const pi = 3.14
pi //=> 3.14
pi == 3.14 //=> true
```

## Explain that JavaScript Has Collections

Sometimes a _variable_ might point to a Thing which actually has multiple
Things inside of it. In programming vocabulary, these collection Things are
called _arrays_. So technically, `Array` belongs with `String` and `Number`.

```javascript
slytherins[0] //=> "Salazar Slytherin"
slytherins[1] //=> "Bellatrix Black"
slytherins[2] //=> "Draco Malfoy"
```

In JavaScript, _arrays_ start at `0`. In America, the floor where you walk in
is called the `1` floor (or first floor). In most of Europe and the rest of the
world, the floor where you walk in is called something else. Arrays are like
that, they start at `0`.

We can get one of the _elements_ of a collection by putting `[]` after a
collection's name and putting a number inside of the `[]`. In the example we
get the `String` names of some wizards stored in a collection of wizards
identified by the name `slytherins`.

## Explain that JavaScript is Object-Oriented

When working with the DOM in JavaScript, many of the things you meet are
_objects_. _Objects_ are bits of code you can talk to that know _state_ and
_behavior_. _Objects_ should round out our universe of JavaScript Things along
with `Array`s, `String`s, and `Number`s.

When talking to an _object_ you can ask it for a bit of _state_ by using a `.`
and then that _state's_ name. You can trigger _behavior_ by using a `.` and
then the _behavior's_ name followed by `()`. Due to the `.` being the separator
between the object-name and the state or behavior name, we call writing code
this way "dot-notation."

The thing that holds a bit of _state_ is known as a _property_. To ask, say, an
adorable poodle its "`name`" state, you would do it like so:


``` javascript
poodle.name //=> "Byron"
```

If you ask an object for a _property_ it doesn't have, JavaScript says
`undefined`

``` javascript
poodle.favoritePainter //=> undefined
```

When asking an object to _do_ something (a _behavior_),  you use a `.` and a
_behavior-name_ (usually a verb) followed by `()`. _Behaviors_ on objects are
called _methods_.

```javascript
poodle.bark() //=> An ear-splitting bark is heard
```

Objects' _methods_ have access to all of that object's properties.

```javascript
poodle.introduceYourselfFormally() //=> "Hello, my name is Byron the poodle"
```

In this case the _method_ `introduceYourselfFormally` presumably looks at
`poodle`'s `name` property and adds some text around it. We might imagine that
it's making `"Hello, my name is " + this.name + " the poodle"`. As it turns
out, that is **entirely valid JavaScript** and it is probably what's happening!

Finally, _methods_ can take _arguments_. _Arguments_ change the _method's_ operation.

```javascript
poodle.eat(1) //=> "Byron eats 1 can of food"
poodle.eat(2) //=> "Byron eats 2 cans of food"
```

_Methods_ can take multiple arguments.

```javascript
poodle.eyeEnviously("Shack Burger", "$", 9.57)
// ==> "Byron eyes your Shack Burger enviously, hoping you will drop some,
// ==> not caring the least that it cost you $9.57."
```

  <figcaption><em>I'm more than behavior and state, I'm a burger-eating machine!</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<br><br>
Here we can imagine JavaScript doing some calculations to turn the `Number`
`9.57` and `String` `$` into the new string `$9.57`. We can also imagine it
using the property of `name` to supply `Byron`.

**A very important object when working with the DOM is called `document`.**

## Explain That JavaScript Is Has Loops

Sometimes you don't want to manually type something out multiple times, but you
want to perform some action "for each" element in a collection. That's where
looping comes in.

In this module, we'll be using a very common loop structure that's found in C,
C++, Java, PHP, and many other languages: The `for` loop.

Let's pull together several of the concepts of this lesson by coding:

"for each" character in the `slytherin` collection (or "`Array`"), we would
like the `harry_potter` object to invoke its `expelliarmus` method on the
wizard or witch who is passed in as an _argument_

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < slytherins.count; i = i + 1) {
  harry_potter.expelliarmus(slytherins[i]);
}
```

The important thing to take away is the ability to "sight read" that `for`
invokes the idea of doing some repeating action for each element in a
collection.

## Explain That JavaScript Logs With `console.log`

In the examples that follow, and in much of the technical documentation of
JavaScript, you will see the following _method_ used: `console.log()`. This
method is used to print something. Often it's used to print out a variable or
some bit of data to make a point or to debug something.

Let's build on the loop example. Let's say we want to know who `harry_potter`
is defending against:


```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < slytherins.count; i = i + 1) {
  console.log(`Harry is about to disarm ${slytherins[i]}`);
  harry_potter.expelliarmus(slytherins[i]);
  console.log(`${slytherins[i]} is defenseless!`);
}
```

We'll discuss this _method_ in more detail later, but it's a way to get
JavaScript to "talk to our screen."


## Conclusion

In this lesson you've learned the "sight words" of basic JavaScript. You should
be able to reason about what code is doing when it works with the DOM in the
subsequent lessons.

Don't forget the power of imagination! By looking at these bits of code, you
can _imagine_ that the code, written by humans just like you _probably does
something like..._. Professional developers try to make their code's function
as "guessable" as possible.

Guesses and imagination are a vital part of your toolkit!
